It has many stories the one that first caught my eye was Mastering the Art of Cybersecurity with AI, it pertains to my group project, It redirects you to a course held on Nvidia’s website and teaches you about Morpheus, which is their AI security framework. I am very interested in diving into this. It gives you a strong overview and then hands-on labs! But overall on The Hacker News, you can find anything from these free lab redirects to well-written articles on things like combating different attacks and how to best prepare your system.\nSource: https://thehackernews.com/"

Everything on this website is written in a very digestible manner for any amount of cybersecurity understanding. It is another blog but it is written by a former New York Times employee Brian Krebs. It offers detailed articles on a multitude of different security topics. He is known for being at the forefront of most major cybersecurity news. Including things like data breaches, cybercrime, malware and so much more. A really interesting read is on Joker’s Stash. It’s his most recent blog and is worth the read.\nSource: https://krebsonsecurity.com/"

    "text": "US Cybersecurity Officials Warn about meddling in elections\n                No matter what side of the isle your political beliefs lie on I think we can all agree that foreign actors trying to change our elections is something we cannot have. This is a growing threat to democracy as we know it. The more our elections become more reliant on computers the more this will happen. I do think it is interesting because I think with good cyber security and potentially forensics, if necessary, it would be a significantly more secure system then just pencil and paper. However, there are very real dangers. There have been vast claims of disinformation coming from outside the country the last few elections and I don’t think that is going to change anytime soon. However, I think at some point there may be a direct attack on voting systems. Which could delegitimize the whole process.\nSource: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/u-s-cybersecurity-officials-warn-of-foreign-efforts-to-sow-doubt-and-chaos-around-election"

But is Co-First Authored by Yazhuo Zhang who recently accepted a postdoctoral fellowship at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. SIEVE is a new way to decide what items should be tossed from a web cache. The beauty of what they have done is it is open source. So not only the scientist from these prestige universities can be the one to work on this but anyone who has an idea can have their input. I think this Is one of the most beneficial changes to computer science. The fact that more people are willing to have their work be open source so we can faster improve in this space."

The four words that pop across the banner of the page when you first access the web page are Discover, Protect, Analyze , and Respond. These are very apt as the tool Guardium does exactly this. The main focus for it are on automating data discovery and classification, meaning it specializes in finding data and the seeing if said data has ny vulnerabilities. I do this human intervention is necessary on the back end to confirm this but it could definitely be a useful tool. Another thing it does is monitor the data it finds and helps to protect it. It can give real time monitoring and you don’t need to have people on the clock. Once again if you are willing to give the program access to the data I can see how as a corporation this would be beneficial in bottom line protection.\nSource: https://www.ibm.com/guardium"

AI in its current form has been utilized for years by cyber security teams. In this report they talk about 3 key areas , which are Attack surface management, AI-powered red teaming and , Posture management. Attack surface management which is I think the most obvious use case for AI in cybersecurity but it is the practice of identifying , monitoring and managing all potential points of exposure. The monitoring is where I think it is most heavily utilized. The next, Ai- powered red teaming, helps identify potential issues within a network. Finally, Posture management after a little research is the monitoring of security configuration. This was a very interesting read and I recommend it to everyone in this class.\nSource: https://securityintelligence.com/articles/3-proven-use-cases-for-ai-preventative-cybersecurity/"
