Proven Use Cases for AI in Preventative Cybersecurity

Although I am unsure of how this number was certified, BM claims that AI-powered automation in cybersecurity has saved organizations an average of \$2.2 million. AI in its current form has been utilized for years by cyber security teams. In this report they talk about 3 key areas , which are Attack surface management, AI-powered red teaming and , Posture management. Attack surface management which is I think the most obvious use case for AI in cybersecurity but it is the practice of identifying , monitoring and managing all potential points of exposure. The monitoring is where I think it is most heavily utilized. The next, Ai- powered red teaming, helps identify potential issues within a network. Finally, Posture management after a little research is the monitoring of security configuration. This was a very interesting read and I recommend it to everyone in this class.
