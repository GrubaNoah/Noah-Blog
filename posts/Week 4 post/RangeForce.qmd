**The Beauty of RangeForce**

By: Noah Gruba

RangeForce is a website with free Cyber security training. It has a ton of modules. It uses virtual machines and real-world scenarios to help get you ready for the real world. It is hands-on and helps you learn how to do things like manage malware all the way to combating modern cyber threats. All in all I have not made it through a ton of these but it does seem to be very well done and is very useful!
